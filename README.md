# 📚 Book Data Cleaning and Analysis

## 📝 Description
This project focuses on **cleaning, transforming, and analyzing book-related data** from a JSON dataset. It includes preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, incorrect formats, and unnecessary columns. The final cleaned dataset is used for **data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## 🔍 Detailed Description
This repository contains a **Python script** that loads book data from an online JSON file, processes it, and performs various data-cleaning operations such as:

- Handling **missing values** and incorrect formats.
- Cleaning **ISBN** numbers and **publication dates**.
- Removing **duplicates** and irrelevant columns.
- Renaming columns for better readability.
- Performing **data visualization** to analyze book publishing trends and status distributions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepares raw JSON data into structured Pandas DataFrame.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses visualizations to extract insights.
- **Automated Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and formatting inconsistencies.
- **Simple and Efficient Code**: Well-commented and easy to understand.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Requests**
- **Regular Expressions (re)**
